# Moyosoreoluwa

Project Name: Moyosoreoluwa Olatosi's Portfolio

The project involved making a personal portfolio to showcase all the assignments I engaed in during my Communication Lab Class. The theme is set to reflect my personality, and I went for a clean design look and a color scheme including my favorite color: orange. To implement the design, I used a simple timeline to display my previous projects in a chronological order and I included a photo gallery containing pictures which give the user a behind the scenes look into some of the activities / content that went into making my various projects. I wanted a very neat, easy to navigate website that also showcased my creativity, and I believe I achieved that using CSS to implement the look and feel of the website and java script to operate an interactive photo gallery with some humorous captions. I look forward to expanding this website to include my other works in my other niches such as poetry and science.
